In this repository there are matrices used for WAS corrected gene insertion site analysis of the article. 

They comes from Aiuti et al. 2013. The authors of the article provided us filtred matrices. 

Here, we focus on 3 patients at 1, 3 and 12 months after gene therapy and two patients at 24 months. 

Samples are named as: organ_cellType_month_patient, like in the metadata file. 

There are CD34pos cells coming from patients bone marrow and lymphocytes and myeloid cells coming from their peripheral blood.
